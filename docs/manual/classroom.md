Play Session in classroom (both modules)
Explain the purpose of the game

Begin by explaining that the game will help them learn new words and aspects of the culture in a fun way. Emphasize that they will be able to explore, solve challenges, and make decisions that will affect the outcome.

Activity types
Class-Wide Game Exploration
Show the kids how to navigate the game. Demonstrate basic controls such as how to move around, interact with objects, and complete the first task or level.
Let the kids explore independently after they understand the basics but be available to answer questions and offer guidance.

Use a projector or a shared screen to display the game while the entire class plays together. The teacher can control the game or ask students to take turns playing in front of the class.
Pause at key moments in the game to ask students what they would do next or to explain cultural or linguistic points related to the game.
This method is great for whole-class discussions and exploring the game as a collective learning experience.

The Discover Europe module has a Tutorial level to be completed.
Individual Play / Independent Learning
The teacher selects a level to be played individually and set a time limit (say 20 minutes).
If needed, set the game in “classroom mode” so to silence the background music and most of the noizy sound fx.
The kids have to finish that level, or stop anyway when the time ends.

Each student plays the game on their own device, working through levels or challenges independently.
This approach encourages self-paced learning, where students can spend more time on challenging areas and move ahead when they feel confident.
Teachers can track progress individually and provide personalized support where needed.

Note: if a kids has already played and finished a level, it isn’t a problem to let them repeat it, also because there are some hidden secrets in every level that can be explored to achieve 100%
Group Play / Pair Learning
Foster collaboration and peer support.

Pair students or put them in small groups where they play the game together. One student might control the game, while others help by giving suggestions or solving puzzles together.
Encourage kids to talk and share strategies and discoveries.
Rotate roles so each student gets a chance to play and contribute.

Research and Google Maps Activity
Engage students in researching more about the subject.

After playing, ask students to do some research about the topic they discovered.
They can use google / search engine, or Google Maps to explore the geographic area
Modification Activity
Engage students in game design thinking.

After playing, ask students to come up with ideas for improving the game or even designing their own level.
They can create new scenarios, characters, or language challenges related to the subject.
Play as homework
The teacher assigns the kids to play a specific level at home. Next week they’ll talk about the contents and discoveries.
Debrief
Reflection questions
After the play session, gather the kids and ask questions such as:

Generic (for example)

What new words or phrases did you learn?
What part of the game was the most challenging?
How did the game help you understand some cultural element?

Specific (for example)

What is Notre Dame de Paris?
How is the Baguette cooked?



Group discussion

Let students share their favorite parts of the game and discuss their play.
Encourage them to explain how the cultural elements in the game connected to what they’ve learned in class or to their personal experiences

Reflection and journaling
To promote metacognitive reflection the students can keep a diary or make drawings about what they learned

After playing, ask students to reflect about the game through writing or discussion.
Encourage them to keep a game journal where they note down what they learned, the challenges they faced
This reflection helps consolidate learning and gives students the chance to think critically about the game experience.
